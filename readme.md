# Learn to learn
The site created as practice work during my studies in Yandex.Practicum for desktops 1100-1550px.
## Tech
- HTML
- CSS (flex, grid, animation)
- БЭМ nested
## Development plan
#### Tech
- Add adaptive version.
- Add a feedback form.
### Design
- Increase the letter spacing for bold small-size font.
- Block "description". Have to add spacing between columns for desktops with a width less than 1200px.
- Blocks "description" and "oakley". Have to align x-height for both columns. Currently, the left column looks higher than the right one.
- Change design for block "khan".  Currently, the picture is too close to the next block and there is too much empty space under the link.
- Have to add contrast for the logo icons that are in the block "resources". Currently, they are too pale.
- The same situation with sm icons in the block "footer".
